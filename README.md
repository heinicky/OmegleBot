![bot](https://files.catbox.moe/w495ya.png)
## Prerequisites
- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Requests Library (`pip3 install requests`)
- Colorama (`pip3 install colorama`)
## Notice
don't use certain keywords like join, or horny, or obvious spammer words, etc. 
and DONT SEND COMPLETE LINKS. if you want to send a discord invite, send an abbreviated one like:

68nCYhgb (clearly a discord invite)

if it gets stuck on connecting to a chat:
go to omegle and do a CAPTCHA. 
if it keeps making you do a captcha you're soft banned. try again in a while.
